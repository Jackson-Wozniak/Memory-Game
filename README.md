# Memory-Game

(Unfinished)

A memory-testing game written in java using Java swing. Uses a connection with a MySQL server (database schema file included) to get and set values to create a leaderboard table once the game ends. Users are prompted to type a username, which would be added to the leaderboard if they reach a top 3 score 

Consists of a grid inlcuding 36 buttons. At each level, an increasing number of buttons
change color for a brief period, and the user must correctly indentify each button that changed color. Game ends if a user guesses
incorrectly 3 times in a single level
